# GitHub Repository Service

A Python-based service that fetches a user's public GitHub repositories.  
It uses the **GitHub API** by default and gracefully falls back to **web scraping** when the API is unavailable or rate-limited.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Retrieves public repositories of any GitHub user
- 🔁 Automatic fallback from API to scraping
- ⚙️ Designed with extensibility and resilience in mind
- 🧪 Suitable for automation, dashboards, and integration into portfolio sites

## 📦 Technologies Used

- Python 3.11.9  
- `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`, and other standard libraries  
- GitHub REST API v3
